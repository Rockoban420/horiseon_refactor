# horiseon_refactor

## Description

Motivation behind this project was to learn how to order and clean up code using semantic HTML elements and re organizing the CSS file to make it more understandable for anybody who opens it, even the visually impaired.
Before the refactor the code was repeating itself and not very cut and dry so after some cleaning and commenting the CSS is much more readable and concise. Also added image descriptions for the visually impaired
I learned about semantic HTML elements and how to use them properly to make the code more readable and also how to organize a CSS file to make it easier to navigate.

## Usage

Just open up the link to the website hosted by Github and the final product should be there working and looking exactly the same as it was before
In case you have no access to the website here it is:
